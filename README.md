  1.If for some reason this does not work, do not worry. It may not work on all web hosts. Open up wp-config-sample.php with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.
  2.Save the file as wp-config.php and upload it.
  3.Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser.

4.If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you. If you did not provide a username, it will be admin.
